                In the summer of 2021, I participated as a researcher for a "In Car Media Experience" project
                 with <a href="https://www.kixlab.org/"> KAIST Interaction Lab </a>and 
                  <a href="https://www.hyundai.com/worldwide/en/"> Hyundai Motor Group</a>. <br/><br/>
                  
                During these 3 months, I research various in-car media experiences people would like to have in cars.
                The main research processes are as below! <br/>
                
                <li>Hyundai Motor Group Workshop</li>
                <li>User Workshop on In-Vehicle Media Experiences</li>
                <li>In-Vehicle Media Experience Prototype Development</li>

								<h2>Hyundai Motor Group Workshop</h2>

								<img  id="center" width="80%" src="./images/cochl.structure.png"/>
								<p>
                  At the start of the research, we had a workshop with Hyundai Motor Group and various media professionals like
                  game graphic designers, sound engineers, and producers. The workshop took place at the Hyundai Motor Group headquarters. 
								</p>

								<p>
                  In this workshop we discussed the current development plans of Hyundai with in-car media experiences and the feasibility of 
                  implementing those plans into cars. It was an eye-opening experience to discuss with various media professionals about the need for 
                  certain designs and the expected challenges with implementing these designs. 
                </p>
                
                <p>
                  I realized that in-car media experiences coupled with car interior design and consideration of the moving space would prove to be 
                  helpful in creating in-vehicle media experiences.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                  The goal of this co-op was to conduct user research on effective in-car media experiences and design prototypes for future user testing. 
								</p>

								<br/>

              <h2>User Workshop</h2>
              
              The first step of this user workshop was to conduct a focus group workshop to understand the user-needs regarding in-car media experiences.
              After conducting some <a href="">paper research</a> we settled on a workshop plan. 
              <br/>
              <br/>
              <h3>Workshop Plan</h3>

              <p>
              The workshop would consist of 3-4 people and take place online through a zoom call. We would be conducting the research on a miroboard. 
              </p>

              <p>
                Steps of the Workshop 
                <ol>
                <li> 
                  After a brief intro on the research goals and motivations, we show the users a video on the imagined in-vehicle media experiences. 
                </li>
                <!-- insert video here  -->

                <li>
                  Activity 1 : Individual ideation
                </li>
                <p>
                  The users use the post-its on the miroboard and think of various "situations" that would require them to use media inside of cars
                </p>
                <p>
                  The users use the post-its on the miroboard and think of various "media activites" that they could do inside of those situations.
                </p>

                <li>
                  Activity 2: Group Ideation 
                </li>
                <p>
                  The users now come together to group their overlapping ideas with keywords. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  Among the overlapping ideas, users choose 3 main scenarios of using media activites and 
                </p>
                </ol>
              </p>

              <h3>User Recruitment</h3>

              <p>
              We recruited the users through list-serv emails with a google form. In the recruitment process, we divided the users into 
              various groups : driver vs passenger / amount of time spent in car / age groups...etc. 
              In coming up with the final research groups, we did our best to mix a variety of user groups together. 
              Additionally, in the recruitment survey, we added survey questions on specific media experiences. Later in our analysis we used 
              these survey questions to analyze our user results. 
              </p>

              <h3>Results Analysis</h3>

              <p>
              With the results of our analysis, we used the notes written on the post-its of the users and conducted a quanitative and qualitative analysis. 
              </p>

              <p>Qualitative Analysis</p>
              <p>The full results of our Qualitative Analysis can be found here </p>

              <p>Quantitative Analysis</p>


              <h3>Prototype Development</h3>
              Based the results of our workshop, we landed at 3 main prototype ideas
              <li>In-car VR Experience</li>
              <li>Car-to-Car Interaction Game</li>
              <li>Music Mixing in Cars</li>

              <p>
                Among these prototype plans, I developed the Car-to-Car Interaction Game. 
              </p>

                Thank you for reading my long review!

  <li><a href="http://eegilbert.org/posts/rejection/">Dealing with Academic Rejection - Eric Gilbert</a></li>
    <p style="font-style:italic;">I followed him out into the hall. I confessed that I had been tracking my global success rate across all my submissions for years, and that it sadly hovered around 45-50%. He told me that was actually pretty good compared to his own, which was around 33%. (Mine has since gone down as I submit more grants.) I admired this guy and his CV, and yet two out of every three things he ever submitted resulted in a rejection email.</p>

    <li><a href="https://michaelnielsen.org/blog/principles-of-effective-research/">Principles of Effective Research - Micheal Nielson</a></li>
    <p style="font-style:italic;">I believe that the foundation of effective research is to internalize a strong vision of what you want to achieve, to work proactively towards that vision, taking personal responsibility for successes and failures. You need to develop disciplined work habits, and to achieve balance between self-development and the actual creative research process.</p>
    <p style="font-style:italic;">Motivation and desire alone are not enough. You also need to have the rest of your life in order to be an effective researcher. Make sure youâ€™re fit. Look after your health. Spend high quality time with your family. Have fun. These things require a lot of thought and effort to get right.</p>

    <p  style="font-style:italic;"> Beyond just what the text says, Lizzy Hadfield blogs remind me to slow down, and calm down. Just take a walk please </p>

    <li><a href="http://incompleteideas.net/IncIdeas/BitterLesson.html">The Bitter Lesson - Richard Sutton</a></li>
    <p  style="font-style:italic;">We have to learn the bitter lesson that building in how we think we think does not work in the long run. The bitter lesson is based on the historical observations that 1) AI researchers have often tried to build knowledge into their agents, 2) this always helps in the short term, and is personally satisfying to the researcher, but 3) in the long run it plateaus and even inhibits further progress, and 4) breakthrough progress eventually arrives by an opposing approach based on scaling computation by search and learning</p>
    <p style="font-style:italic;">the actual contents of minds are tremendously, irredeemably complex; we should stop trying to find simple ways to think about the contents of minds, such as simple ways to think about space, objects, multiple agents, or symmetries. All these are part of the arbitrary, intrinsically-complex, outside world. They are not what should be built in, as their complexity is endless; instead we should build in only the meta-methods that can find and capture this arbitrary complexity. </p>
    <p style="font-style:italic;">We want AI agents that can discover like we can, not which contain what we have discovered. Building in our discoveries only makes it harder to see how the discovering process can be done.</p>
